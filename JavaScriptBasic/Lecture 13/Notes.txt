Example for object:
    object {
        owner="", 
        date="", 
        vip="", 
        manufacture = "", 
    }

    Here the keys are the permanent values - owner, date, vip, manufacturer.
    The values are the properties that will be changed in the keys.

Local storage - data that will be saved on our local storage - our computer - someone else can't get access to our storage when using other computer.

To save on the local storage, we will use this in the JavaScript:
    This will convert the object into a JSON string:
        - localStorage.setItem("myData", JSON.stringify(droneList));
            - "myData" is the key.
    This will convert the JSON into an object.
        - droneList = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("myData"));
        

When using 'setItem' - we will create the local storage object.
When using 'getItem' - we will get the data from the local storage.
