The Frontend is sending us requests toward the BackEnd.
Those requests are called REST requests.
Finally we will get a response as well.

The REST requests that are being sent from the Frontend are being sent to the Routes in the Backend.
    Examples for Routes:
        - /api/2/getAllCar         - POST
        - /api/2/getCar?id=1113334 - GET

From the Routes, all the requests will be sent to the Logic.
    - Meaning - the Routes are visible to the client and the Logic is visible only to the developer.
    - I will never make Logic visible to the client.
    - Routes = EndPoints.
    - The Logic can be:
        - Another API.
        - DataBase (mysql, noSql-mongoDB).
        - Writing to the HardDisk.
        - And many more.

Between the Routes and the Logic, we have the MiddleWare.
    - The MiddleWare responsibility is to intercept (ליירט) the request, check the request correctness, extract data that I need for later, and to continue (next). 

Between the Logic and the Logic "EndPoints", we have DAL - Data Abstract Layer.
    - Using DAL - when the signal will be "released", the switch will be very very fast, if I will work correctly and using DAL.
    - We are using DAL so we can switch between different sql softwares. 

When using status code 204 - I will not return any response (This code is for delete method).

When sending a request to the server, the server will send a response.
    - The response that is returned is divided into three main parts.
        1. Header.
        2. Body - the info I would like to receive.
        3. Status.
    - Sometimes we won't get any body. 
        - For example, when using DELETE, we won't get a body in a response.
        - BUT, we still can add a body in a response of the DELETE method, for example: "video was deleted successfully".    

Once I have Route, I am turning to the Logic.

JWT - JSON Web Token.

   Req     
-> REST    
-> BackEnd 
-> MiddleWare - before you reach the Logic, I will check all the requests and I will check if I need to send the request to the Logic or not, and by that I can save a lot of money, also, I may create a new token 
-> Logic.
