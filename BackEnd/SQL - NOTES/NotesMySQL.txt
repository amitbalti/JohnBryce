SELECT   *     FROM    countrylanguage    WHERE            countrycode='ETH' 
select   all   from    main folder        which column     which thing  type of language

SELECT count(language) FROM countrylanguage WHERE language='Dutch' <== will find to me how many countries are talking in Dutch.

SELECT count(language) as total FROM countrylanguage WHERE language='Dutch' <== will give me a name to see how many countries are talking in Dutch = with the name 'total'

I can also break the query by lines:
    SELECT count(language) as total 
    FROM countrylanguage 
    WHERE language='Arabic'
