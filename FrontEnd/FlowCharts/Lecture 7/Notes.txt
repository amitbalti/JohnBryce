With the <script> tag we can add a JS file or we can write the JS code within the script tag.
'var' is a variable. 
Variables will be written like that:
    var thisIsAnExample = ;
    Between the equal sign and the ';', we have different types of variables that can be chosen from:
        - number - any number.
        - string - will be write between "".
        - boolean - can be either 'true' or 'false'.
        - function - can be written like that: () => {} - this is an arrow function.
        - object - can be written like that: new Object().
        - undefined - can be written by just the name of the variable - without make it equal to anything.
