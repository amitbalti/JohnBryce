To add a JS file to the HTML file, we will use the '<script></script>' tag.
With 'src=""' of the JS file.

Because the script is at the top of the HTML page, we may have problems and errors.
To solve it, some people put the 'script' tag at the end of the code - which may cause multiplication of the code.
Some people will use the 'onload' in the body, like this:
  <body onload="sayHiToHila()"> 
    
The correct way to solve it is with using 'defer' in the script.
defer - will load the script after the body was fully uploaded.
    Example:
        <script defer src="../demo1_dom_js/js/myjs.js"></script>

Using 'onclick' in button - will cause something when clicking on the button.
'onclick' will get or a function or a action.

Until now we wrote: 
    function addNumbers(num1,num2){
        return num1+num2;
    }

From now on we can write:
    const addNumber(num1,num2)=>{
        return num1+num2;
    }

Those two ways are doing exactly the same.
