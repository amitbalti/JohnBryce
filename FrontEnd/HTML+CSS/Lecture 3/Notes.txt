<tag>:first-child {
}
    Will give the things to the first div in the index.


<tag>:nth-child() {
}
    Will give the div with the number which is written between the brackets.
        For example:
            div:nth-child(5) {
                font-weight: bold;
            }
            This will create the 5th div on the index all be in bold.

////////////////////////////////////////////////

'keyframes' will create animation.

We first need to make it in css like that:
    For example:
        @keyframes policeLight {
            0% {
                background-color: blue;
            }
            25% {
                background-color: red;
            }
            50% {
                background-color: blue;
            }
            75% {
                background-color: red;
            }
        }

        The percentages is the time line.

    Next in the component we want to insert the animation on, we will write the name of the animation when using the 'animation-name' attribute and then we can use other attributes to give the component other settings.
    For example:
        figure {
            animation-name: policeLight;
            animation-duration: 3000ms;
            animation-iteration-count: infinite;
            animation-delay: 50ms;
        }   

'animation-duration' will give the animation the time the animation will set.
'animation-iteration-count' - will make the animation have a limit according to the thing we will set. We can also set it to infinite.

////////////////////////////////////////////////

'position: realtive;' - means that the component will be positioned relatively to the "father".
    For example:
        <body>
            <img/>
        </body>

        In this case, if we will put the 'img' tag position 'relative' so the 'img' will move relatively to the 'body' tag.


'vh' will give us a better responsive animation than 'px', relatively to the screen of the device we are using.
'vh' = View port Height. נותן את הקנה מידה מול המסך.

To center all the content in the html - use 'justify-content: center;'
