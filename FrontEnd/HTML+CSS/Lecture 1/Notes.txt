WWW = World Wide Web.
W3C = The World Wide Web Consortium - the main international standards organization for the WWW.
    W3C Markup Validation Service = http://validator.w3.org/
In web server we have the client side and the server side.
Client - can be anything that receives the info that is being sent from the Web Server.
Web Browsers - a browser that gives users the ability to communicate through the internet and get info from the Web Servers.
    - Major Web Browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Explorer, Opera, Safari and more.
In order to communicate, computers need to "speak the same language". 
Over the internet computers communicate with HTTP.
Both server and client needs to understand HTTP.
HTTP = HyperText Transfer Protocol - it's a request-response protocol. 
    HTTP - common communication protocol.
HTTPS = HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure - means we have a secure communication.

Slide 13-
Slide 14- Internet network is built on layers - UDP / TCP communication.
Slide 15- IP - Internet Protocol.
Today we are using IPv6.
Clients usually obtain dynamic IP every time they connect.
IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to every device in the cyberspace.
Clients, Servers and other devices have there own IP address. For example: (slide 20) 
IP address has 4 sections separated by dot, called IPv4. (slide 21)
URI = Uniform Resource Identifier. (slide 23)
SSL - secured socket layer - used in HTTPS.
FTP = File Transfer Protocol - used for uploading and downloading files from servers.
XML = eXtessible Markup Language - an old version of HTML.

! + enter = Give us the basic HTML template.
We are working with SPA - Single Page Application -> Everything will be in the same page


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Tags can have characteristics and inside info.
We have two types of tags: 
    <center></center> - center the text tag 
    <hr/> - gives us a horizontal line.
    <h1> until <h6> - gives our text different sizes of text - when h1 is the largest and h6 is the smallest.
    <p> - create a space above and below the paragraph.
    <ul> - unordered list.
    <ol> - ordered list.
    <li> - one item from the list.

Remember to write where you got this from:
    https://pexels.com/ - web for images
    https://pixabay.com/ - web for images videos music and more. 


Attribute: 
    - The character of the tag. For example, in <img> we have the 'src' attribute.
    - We have 'class' and 'id' attributes. 
        - We use the 'class' and the 'id' with CSS for styling and for other programming languages.

Make sure to divide the files into separate folders.
