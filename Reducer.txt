The reducer manage the state for us.


But what happen when I have few reducers to manage in the app?

//////

enum works the best with switch.
When using switch, the enum will remove the stuff we already used in the switch. 
Therefore we will not use the same thing twice, because it will already be deleted/used.

switch works the best with numbers and not with strings.
