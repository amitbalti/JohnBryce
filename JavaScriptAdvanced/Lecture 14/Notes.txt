We can't use both let and var on the same variable.
A wrong example:
    let a = 4;
    {
        var a;
        console.log(a);
    }

We will not use any global variables anymore!
To do that, at the top of the page we will use: "use strict";
This will not let us to define global variables.


//////
'prototype' - how to create stuff that will occur automatically.
Using prototype - we can change an existing object.
With prototype we can change not only variables.

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
