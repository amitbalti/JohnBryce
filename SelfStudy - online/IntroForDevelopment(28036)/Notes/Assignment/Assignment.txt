Sometimes we will want some in-between calculations that won't show as a output.

In web development, to calculations there is no meaning for the calculations if we won't save their outcome.

An expression can be a numerical value (1,2,3), a text will be between quotation marks "" ("example"), identifier of a variable or a calculation.
The value of the expression will be copied to the variable.

An expression is equal to a cell.

The two examples in the 'examplesPage13' file:
    1. Receiving two numbers and showing their sum.
       There is an option to put more than one assignment in one assignment junction.
       The assignments will occur one after the other, from top to bottom.
    2. Receiving two numbers and showing their average.

What is the key (מקרא)?
    Assignment opens the option for us to save data in different variables beyond from the data within the input.
    About the key we will write at the side of our flowchart, with a short description of what their job is.
    Example can be found in the 'examplesPage13' file.
        - Note - there is no obligation to indicate the input variables in the key (for example - a, b).
