///////// Output /////////

Output - is the outcome of running the algorithm. In most cases the outcome of the output will change, accordingly to the input that will be received during the algorithm process.
Mostly the output will be considered as the print to the screen.

In the output junction, we will write a expression or a list of expressions.

An expression can be:
    - Number which can't be change.
    - Text within brackets.
    - Identifier of a variable (a name).
    - Calculations.
    - List of expressions.

    Examples can be found in the 'output-examples.png' file.

////// Tip //////

In every solution there is at least one output junction.
