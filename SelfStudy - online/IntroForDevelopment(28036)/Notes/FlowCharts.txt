FlowCharts are a diagram that will describe the algorithm.

The flowchart is made up from junctions which are connected between them through a line.

Outside of the junctions and lines, we write notes.

///////// Junctions /////////

There are three types of Junction:
    1. Start and stop junctions.
    2. Start junction is represented with ellipse and contain the title 'start'.
        - Meaning - the beginning of the algorithm.
        - The direction of the flow - the next junction will be in the direction of the line.
    3. Stop junction is represented with ellipse and contain the title 'stop'.
        - Meaning - the end of the algorithm.
        - The direction of the flow - there is no other junctions.

In every flowchart there is one start and one stop junctions.
