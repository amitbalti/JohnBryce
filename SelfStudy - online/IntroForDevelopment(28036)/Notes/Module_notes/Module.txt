A % B (A module B) is the remnant from the whole division of A in B.
    Example:
        100 % 30 = 10
        Meaning - 30 get into 100, 3 whole times.
                  But, 3 times 30 are 90, and we left with remnant of 10 (module).

The module is useful to:
    - To know if one whole is dividing by the other without a remnant (meaning that the remnant is 0).
        - In the above example, 100 is NOT dividing by 30 without a remnant.
    - To describe "circular" numeric timeline - from 0 till a whole and going back to 0. 
        - For every whole module 30 there will be a result between 0 to 29.
            - In the diagram in file "circlePage14" there is a circular timeline from 0 to 29.
              In order to calculate 100%30, using the diagram, we need to start from 0, and move 100 lines in clock direction.
              When we finish we will stand on line 10. 

Tip - when dividing, leave the numbers as is, without reduction.

/////// Full Assignment ///////

The operator (int) will reduce part of the fraction from the expression and will leave the whole.

    For example - in the file 'examplePage14':
        Receiving the number of kids and the number of cake slices. 

        Showing the number of cake slices that each kid can get and the number of cake slices that will be remain.
