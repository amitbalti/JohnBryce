Mathematical expression is made up from operators and operants.

    - Operator - the sign that represents the action.
    - Operant - the value which the action is made on.

        Example: 
            In the expression 1+2, the '+' is the operator and he is executing an action on the operants - the numbers (1, 2).

For every operator there is a different priority. To change the order of the actions, we use brackets '()'.

Mathematical operators:
    ('a' and 'b' are numerical expressions).

    Priority 1:
        - (a) - brackets - will change the order of the calculation.
        - |a| - absolute value - if a is negative -a, it will remain a.
        - +a - plus - a.
        - -a - minus - will turn a from negative to positive and vice versa.

    Priority 2: 
        - a * b - multiplier - a times b.
        - a/b - division - a divided by b.
        - a%b - modulo - returns the remainder or signed remainder of a division, after one number is divided by another.

    Priority 3: 
        - a+b - addition - a plus b.
        - a-b - subtraction - a minus b.
