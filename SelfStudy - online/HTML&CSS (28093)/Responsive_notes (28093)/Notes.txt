Responsive page means that the page will fit to both a larger or a smaller devices.

There is a 'meta' tag that is called 'viewport'. This tag will adjust the size of the page content to the device screen.

When we want to create a responsive web page, we will avoid using absolute numbers (for example 300px for width), we will instead use percentages.

Another thing we can use is '@media' in the style of the page. 
    For example: 
        @media only screen and (max-width: 1024px) and (max-height: 768px) {}
        @media only screen and (min-width: 400px) and (min-height: 300px) {
            li {
                display: inline;
            }
        }
