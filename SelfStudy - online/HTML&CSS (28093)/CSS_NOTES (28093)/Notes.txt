CSS = Cascading Style Sheets.
HTML will set the information of the page.
CSS rule is to give us a really wide range of styling to our HTML page.

When we are working with CSS, there are three ways to work with it:
    1. Inline syntax - means that we are setting the style to a specific tag.
        For example: <tag style="attribute:value; attribute:value;"></tag>
        Another example: <p style="color: blue; letter-spacing: 20px;">hello</p>
    2. In head CSS - means that in the head section of the HTML page we will use the 'style' tag and we will set all the settings we want of the CSS to a specific page.
    3. External CSS document - will help us set certain settings to a wide HTML pages. With that we can set a certain settings for let's say headers, and use the same headers for more than one page. With that we will write less code and we will be more efficient.
    To line the external CSS page to a HTML, we will set the 'link' tag at the head section, we will do it like this: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css>
