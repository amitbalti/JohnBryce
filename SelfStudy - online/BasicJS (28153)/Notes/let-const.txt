When using the 'let' keyword to define a variable, we can change the value/data of the variable as many times as we would like.

When using the 'const' keyword to define a variable, we can NOT change the value/data of the variable at all. The value we will define to the variable at the first time, this will be the value of this variable.
    Example:
        const lastName = "Balti";
        lastName = "Cohen";
        console.log(lastName);

    This will give us an error because we already defined the const and we can't change it's value.

We also always have to give our 'const' variable immediately a value, otherwise, we will get an error.
    For example:
        const x;
        x=56;
        console.log(x);
    This will give us an error.
