//// prompt ////
We can ask from our user to give us a certain value.
To do that we will use the 'prompt' operator, which will basically give the use the option to write whatever he wants.
    Example:
        let firstName = prompt("What is your first name?");
        console.log(`Welcome ${firstName}`);
    Here the user will have to write his first name and press ok/hit enter.
    Then his name will show up in the console.
    If the user will hit the 'cancel' button we will get 'null' in the console - no value.

We can also set a default value that will show up inside the prompt, even before the user will write anything.
    Example:
    let firstName = prompt("What is your first name?", "Amit");
    console.log(`Welcome ${firstName}`);

The type of 'prompt' is string.

To make the type of 'prompt' to be a number, we will do it like that:
    let age = +prompt("What is your age?");
    console.log(typeof age);
