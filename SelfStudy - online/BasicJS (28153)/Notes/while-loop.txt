We have three types of loops - 
    1. while loop.
    2. for loop.
    3. do while loop.

A loop will give me the option to make a bunch of actions, until we tell it to stop.

///// While Loop /////

We will use the 'while' syntax. 
Then between the brackets we will ask a boolean question.

Example:
    let number = 1;
    while (number <= 100) {
        console.log(number);
        number++;
    }
Here while the number is between 1 and 100 including 100, then the console will print the number and then will move one number further.
When the number will be equal to 101, our while loop will stop.
