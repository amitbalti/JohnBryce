In the for loop we can write all of our properties to the loop in one line:

For example:
    for (let num = 1; num <= 100; num++) {
        console.log(num);
    }
Here basically the loop is saying that first, 'num' variable is equal to 1.
Then, it will check if the 'num' variable is equal to 100 or less.
Lastly, the 'num' variable will go to the next 'num' (for example if num=3, then the next 'num' will be 4).
This will continue until the num will be equal to more than 100.

We can also put if statement inside a loop.
For example:
    for (let num = 1; num <= 100; num++) {
        if (num % 2 == 0) {
            console.log(num);
        }
    }
Here, every number that his modulo 2 will be equal to 0, is a even number.

Another way to find only the even numbers with only the for loop:
    for (let num = 2; num <= 100; num += 2) {
        console.log(num);
    }
Here the number start in two, and it will promote in two places, therefore it will be checking for all the even numbers.
