Variables are cells in the memory of our computer. Those cells will save some data for us.
Later on we can use the variables, we can change the variables values and so on.

To declare a variable we will use the word 'let' then we will give the variable a name and finally, we will give the variable a data.
    For example:
        let age = 30;

After using the word 'let' to set up a variable, we can still change the value / data of the variable. 
To do it, there is no need to use the word 'let' before the variable name again, instead we will only write the name of the variable and the new value/data of the variable. 
    For example: 
        age = 34;

A variable can have only one value, not more.

We can define multiple variables in one line, using one 'let'.
    For example:
        let firstName, lastName;
        firstName = "Amit";
        lastName = "Balteriski";

If we will use this example:
        let firstName, lastName;
        console.log(firstName);

    The console will show us 'undefined' - this means that this variable didn't get a value/data.

We can create a variable which his data will contain other variables.
    For example:
      let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
    We can also show it like that:
      let fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
