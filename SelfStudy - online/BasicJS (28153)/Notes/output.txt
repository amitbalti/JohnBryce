//// alert ////
'alert()' is giving me the option to show output in the web page. Within the brackets we will use "" and write whatever we want.
'alert' will be showed as a popup message, it will appear any time we will refresh the web page.
    Example:
        alert("Hello World!")

//// console.log ////
'console.log()' - will show us any output we want to see in the console of our webpage.
'console.log' is being used mostly for the developers and less for the users.
    Example:
        console.log("Hello World");

//// document.write ////
'document.write()' - will be showed similarly to a paragraph tag in HTML.
    Example:
      document.write("Hello World <br>on document");
