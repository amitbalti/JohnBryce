Array is a type of data that is used to save some data - it can be a number , it can be a string, and basically every data that js can work with.

Array is represented with the square brackets - [].

The attribute '.push()' - will push the data into the array.
For example:
    let arr = [];
    for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
        arr.push(+prompt("Please enter your grade"));
    }


The first place in the array will start with 0. 

Example:
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        document.write(arr[i]);
    }
'arr.length' will return the size of the array.
arr[i] will relate to the specific element in the array.

'push()' is pushing the data into the end of the array.

We can also change the value of a certain index in the array.
For example:
    let arr = [100, 95, 85, 90];

    arr[1] = 80;
Here, we basically changes the value 95 to 80.
