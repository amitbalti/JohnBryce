Operators allows us to make different actions between variables, and also between functions.

//// Addition ////
For example, we can add up two variables:
    let num1 = 20;
    let num2 = 30;
    let num3 = num1 + num2;
    console.log(num3);

//// Subtraction ////
We can also subtract the variables from one another, for example:
    let num4 = num2 - num1;
    console.log(num4);

//// Multiplication ////
We can also multiply the variables with one another, for example:
    let num5 = num1 * num2;
    console.log(num5);

//// Division ////
We can also divide one variable with another, for example:
    let num6 = num2 / num1;
    console.log(num6);

//// Modulo ////
Modulo is represented with '%'. 
Modulo will show us the remnant of the division of two numbers.
This is basically saying, how many times one variable can get inside another variable.
    Example:
        let num1 = 20;
        let num2 = 30;  
        let num7 = num2 % num1;
        console.log(num7);
    Here num1 will fit only one time in num2. The remnant will be 10, so it will print us 10.
    If num2 will be 60 -> num2 % num1 -> will be equal to 0 - there is no remnant left.
    If num2 will be 65 -> num2 % num1 -> will be equal to 5.

//// ++ ////
To add only one to the variable, we will use '++' operator.
    Example:
        let num1 = 20;
        num1++;
        console.log(num1);
    It's like saying:
        num1 = num1 + 1;
    The console will show 21.

//// -- ////
To subtract only one from the variable, we will use '--' operator.
    Example:
        num1 = 21;
        num1--;
        console.log(num1);
    It's like saying:
        num1 = num1 - 1;
    The console will show 20.

//// *= ////
A shorter way to multiply our current variable with another one.
    Example:
        let num8 = 4;
        num8 *=3;
        console.log(num8);
    It's like saying:
        num8 = num8 * 3;
    The console will show 12.

//// /= ////
A shorter way to divide our current variable with another one.
    Example:
        let num8 = 12;
        num8 /=3;
        console.log(num8);
    It's like saying:
        num8 = num8 / 3;
    The console will show 4.

//// -= ////
A shorter way to subtract our current variable with another one.
    Example:
        let num8 = 12;
        num8 -=3;
        console.log(num8);
    It's like saying:
        num8 = num8 - 3;
    The console will show 9.

//// += ////
A shorter way to add our current variable with another one.
    Example:
        let num8 = 12;
        num8 +=3;
        console.log(num8);
    It's like saying:
        num8 = num8 + 3;
    The console will show 15.
