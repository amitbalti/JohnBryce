There are different types of data that we can store.
To find out the type of the variable we are using we can use this:
        console.log(typeof());
    Between the brackets we will write the name of the variable.
    For example:
        console.log(typeof(age));
    This will be number.

//// Number ////
We have number.
    For example: 
        let age = 34;
    The data that is being store in our age variable is a number type.
We don't care if the number is whole or with remnant.
    For example:
        age = 37.2; 
        This is still a number.

//// String ////
We have variable with the type of string.
String is basically text which are found within "" or ''.
    For example:
        let firstName, lastName;
        firstName = "Amit";
        lastName = "Balteriski";

//// Boolean ////
Boolean type of variable means that the answer for the variable can either be 'true' or 'false'.
    For example:
      let isUserAgree = true;
    Or it can be 
      let isUserAgree = false;
