The structure of the 'do-while' loop:
    do {

    }
    while();
Inside the 'do' block, we will have all the actions we want to use.

Example:
    do {
        let number = +prompt("Please enter a number");
    }
    while(number != 999);

    Here, every time the loop will run, we will get a number from the user.
    Our stoppage sign will be found within the brackets next to the 'while' syntax.
    In this case, the do-while loop will stop when the number will be equal to 999.

The difference between the 'while' loop and the 'do-while' loop, is that in the 'while' loop the computer is first checking for the condition.
Then if the condition is true, the loop will continue. If it will be false, the loop will not even start.
In the 'do-while' loop, the computer is first making the action and then it's checking for the condition.

When we will use the 'do-while' loop? 
    When we want that the loop will occur at least once. If not, we can use the 'while' loop.
