We can change one type of variable to another.

//// String -> Number ////

1. For example we have this variable:
        let salary = "12000";
    This is a variable with the type of string.
    If we want to change the type of the variable to a number type, we will write it like that:
        salary = Number(salary);
    This will convert the type of the 'salary' variable from 'string' to 'number'.

We can also take a number which have a remnant and to remove the remnant of the number and leave it as a whole number.
To do it we will use the attribute 'parseInt'.
    For example:
        let age = 25.2;
        console.log(parseInt(age));
    This will make the number a whole number and convert it into 25.

2. Using 'parseInt' with a string, will first make the string into a number, and then will remove the remnant of the number.
    For example:
        let age2 = "25.7";
        console.log(parseInt(age2));
    
3. Another way to convert from string to number is by putting '+' before the variable name.
    For example:
        let age3 = "25.7";
        console.log(typeof +age3);


//// Number -> String ////

1. A way to convert from number to string is by using the '.toString()' attribute.
    For example:
        let someNumber = 1234;
        console.log(typeof someNumber);
        someNumber = someNumber.toString();
        console.log(typeof someNumber);

2. We can also do it the other way around:
    For example we have this variable:
        let age = 25;
    This is a variable with the type of number.
    If we want to change the type of the variable to a string type, we will write it like that:
        age = String(age);
    This will convert the type of the 'age' variable from 'number' to 'string'.
