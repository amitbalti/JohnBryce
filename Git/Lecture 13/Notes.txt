We are using 'main' as our project main folder.
Branch - Another "desktop" that we will have all the files from the main folder .
       - The branch have files that won't be in the main folder until we merge them together. 
       - When we want to, we can merge the files from the branch into the main folder.

    "git checkout -b newbranch" - will create a new branch.

Fork - repository of someone else.
Branch - my own - can use on someone else's project after doing 'fork'.
