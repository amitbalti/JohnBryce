////////////// Bootstrap ///////////////

Two things we need to use in order to work with Bootstrap:
    - We need to link a stylesheet to an external website:
        <link
         rel="stylesheet"
         href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
        />
    - We need to link a JS to our HTML:
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>

    Both of the links are permanent (just need to change for the newer version).

To start working with bootstrap, we need to use a div with a class, for example: class="container bg-warning"
    'bg-warning' means: 'bg' = background. 'warning' = yellow.

What special about bootstrap? 
    - It will make things shorter. 
    - It's solving the problem of responsiveness - it will make things look better per device. 

With class 'container' it will give us margins in both left and right. - The main reason using 'container' is to have the option to put ads.
With class 'fluid' it will not give us margins in both left and right.

In bootstrap we can divide each row to 12 equal pieces.
    Example:
        <div class="row">
            <span class="col-2 bg-danger">Amit</span>
            <span class="col-8 bg-info">Balteriski</span>
            <span class="col-2 bg-success">Class 89</span>
        </div>
        Here we are making the first span getting 2 pieces from the row, the second span getting 8 pieces from the row and the last span will get 2 pieces from the row. 
        We have to write in the div 'class="row"'.

Everything we need to know in bootstrap is div and classes.

cdn = content delivery network - the computer will chose the closest cdn to himself.
As the version we are using is newer, it will be more secure to use.

'&nbsp;' will give us a blank.
