Only in HTML5 we start the doc with <!DOCTYPE html> - which tells us that we are using html5.

In input we can use the 'placeholder' attribute to give the input a name that will disappear once we start typing.

//////////// Forms ////////////

In input we have different type attribute:
    - 'text' - to write text.
    - 'email' - to write email (with '@' and '.com/.co.il').
    - 'tel' - to write phone number.
    - 'checkbox' - we can choose more than one "answer".
    - 'radio' - we can choose only one "answer" - the radio button needs to be grouped - so we need to give it a 'name' which will group all the relevant radio.
    - 

When we write 'checked' in the input (for example in 'checkbox' or 'radio') - will automatically check it - but we can change it.
When we write 'disabled' in the input (for example in 'checkbox' or 'radio') - will automatically disable the option - but we can change it.

We have 'select' tag which will give us a list of options which we can choose only one of them.
    - Within the select tags we will write the options with the 'option' tag.
    - To preselect one of the options (to show it first) we will use the 'selected' attribute.
    - To disable one of the options we will use the 'disabled' attribute.

We have the 'textarea' tag, which will give us a text box. 
    - We will use the 'rows' and 'cols' attributes - to give the textarea a size.

//////////// Table ////////////

All the relevant tags for table:
    - 'thead' - will give the heads of the tables.
    - 'tr' - will give new row to the table.
    - 'td' - inside the tr we will use it to give the table some data.
    - 'tbody' - the body of the table with all the data. 

'padding' - make the inner space be more spacious.

//////////// CSS ////////////

We have three types of CSS:

    1. Inline styling - within the lines of the HTML sheet.
    2. In the head section of the HTML sheet (we will write <style></style> and within it we will write the styling).
    3. In a CSS doc which we will link to the HTML sheet.

To use the outside CSS sheet, we will use 'id' and 'class'.
The most common one being used is 'class'.
We will write the 'id' and the 'class' within the tags. 

'.' represents the 'class' and then we write the name of the class.

'#' represents the 'id' and the we write the name of the class.

'::' - selector, we can choose for example the first latter of the class.
    Example: 
        .story::first-letter{
            font-size: 30px;
        }

CSS general tags (no need to write anything before):
    - 'body' - will do styling to the whole page.

'span' tag will be for a specific word or sentence.

We can choose more than one 'class' per component but only one 'id'.

The last styling is the one that makes the tone.

To make the whole body of will go to the right, we will use 'direction: rtl' in the css. (Will move everything to the right - not only the text).

The min of 'padding' and 'margin' will be 0px.

ul > li - means that li is the child inside the ul.

'%' - is relatively to the screen size.

To give different components the same style, we will write it like that:
    table,
    th,
    td {
        border: 1px solid;
        border-collapse: collapse;
        padding: 10px;
        text-align: center;
    }

tr:nth-child(even) - nth-child - means any number inside the tr || even - means all the even numbers - 2,4,6,8 ect.
tr:nth-child(odd) - nth-child - means any number inside the tr || odd - means all the odd numbers - 1,3,5,7 ect.

To choose the first child of a component:
    thead tr:first-child {
        background-color: gray;
    }

To choose the last child of a component:
    tr:last-child {
        background-color: red;
    }


'kbd' tag means keyboard tag - it's written like a code is being written - when we want to show something like a code line.
