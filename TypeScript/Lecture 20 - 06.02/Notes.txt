class folder in our project - in shortcut - cls.

35 mintues of the class - look again.
After 2 HOURS = GO OVER IT!
ALSO - TEST NEXT WEDNESDAY! GO OVER JQUERY AND AJAX!!!

gettering and settering - gettering means get something. settering means set something.

When using 'get' we can use the 'return'. 
When using 'set' we will not use the 'return'.

Using OOP makes the program have less problems and mistakes.
