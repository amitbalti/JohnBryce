///// Inheritance //////
    - Inheritance is one of the most important principles im developing OOP.

    - Each inheritance is made up of two degrees:
        - Base class - it's the inherit class (base class / super class).
        - Derivative class - is the inheritor class (derived class / sub class).

    - Right planning of hierarchy, needs to think of future needs that might evolve.

    // Inheritance Execution //
        - In order to execute the inheritance, we need to right in the inheritor class which is the inherit class. 
            It will be done in the same way:
                class Person {
                }

                class Worker extends Person{
                }

                Worker = Derivative class.
                Person = Base class.
        
        - Important points for inheritance:
            1. The relation of inheritance is going one way:
                -  To the base class there is no info about the derivative class, and it can't get access to the stuff inside the derivative class.
            2. The derivative class gets all the characteristics and functions from the base class and can access them (ONLY if they are NOT private).
                - It's like in the real world - every kid inherit the genes from it's parents, but the genes of the parents won't be affected by the genes of their kids.
            3. The usage of the inheritor class is used as a regular class.
            4. In inheritance, every
