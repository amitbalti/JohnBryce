Transformation of data in React:
    - In order to transfer data from component A to B, we used props.
    - In order to create communication between two components which doesn't have connection, I used Redux/Contex.

In Angular:
    - We have the App, which within the App we have the 'user input', and we have two directives - one - list-items, two - item according to ngFor. 
    
/// Service (In Angular) ///
    - We also have the Service which is like the Redux.
    - All of the other directives are "talking" with the Service, but no one is talking to one another.
    - We can import or export data from the Service.

The advantages of the Service are split into four (usually):
    1. Coding of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).   
    2. Separate between getting the data and the way we display the data. Will be valid to all the topic of AJAX (I don't know when I will get it, and when I will get it, I will want to work with it).
    3. If the service will fall, the app won't fall, I can turn on the service all over again.
    4. Decreasing the load on the system. That's because I don't need to check every time when the data arrived. The service will let me know when I have data.

If a Service is falling, I can say for example 'if I didn't get a response in five minutes for example, create new or restart yourself'.

DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself.

SYNC action - action which is going one after the other.
ASYNC - actions which can happen in the same time (parallel to one another).

//// NgModule ////
    - When we are talking about the NgModule, we are talking about the base of Angular, it's core.


//// _val ////
    - '_val' is a temporary variable.
    - After you are transfering the variable, there is no other use of this variable.
    - He is only used for transfering data/info.
    - Example:
        addFruit(_val: string) {
            this.fruits_ar.push(_val);
        }

//// @Injectable ////
    - Instead of importing the Service into the app module, I will use '@Injectable' instead.
    - This will automatically import the Service into the app module.
